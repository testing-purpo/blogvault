Penetration Testing

Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do. 
It’s about thinking like an attacker — probing for weak spots, misconfigurations, or overlooked flaws.
Whether it’s SQL injection etc , the goal is the same: break it before someone else does. Curiosity fuels every good pentest.
