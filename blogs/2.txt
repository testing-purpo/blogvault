Security Tips

Protecting your digital identity is critical. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
Avoid clicking suspicious links or sharing personal data online. Keep software up to date, and don’t ignore browser warnings.
Most importantly — never trust user input blindly. Sometimes, what breaks your site is what teaches you.                                
Start reading, stay curious… and maybe uncover something not meant to be found.
