Working of the Web

The web works through a simple request-response model. A browser sends a request to a server, which returns HTML, CSS, or data.
Behind the scenes, sessions, forms, and parameters shape what users see.
But small missteps — like trusting the wrong input — can change everything. Always know what you're serving.
